# May the Force

## The instructions, from `master`, have been modified.

This is an application that uses [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) (the Star Wars API) to provide users with characters from the canonical universe of Star Wars. 

Do the following to run:
  1. ~~Verify that NPM is installed on your machine by running `npm -v`.~~
  2. ~~Travel to the root folder.~~
  3. ~~Type `npm install`.~~
  4. ~~Type `npm start`.~~
  5. ~~Head to `localhost:1337`.~~
  6. To add a new person and year of birth, click "May the Force Be with You, Always."
  7. When the screen starts filling up with data, blast it away with the Death Star!
  8. Enjoy!

## This branch, `gh-pages`, is for demonstration purposes. Some of the code from `master` has not been carried over so that `gh-pages` will be served properly. In other words, head to [May the Force](https://feedthemind.github.io/mayTheForce)!
